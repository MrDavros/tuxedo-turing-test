# The Tuxedo Turing Test (TTT)

**Can AI tell the difference between genuine innovation and sophisticated nonsense?**

This repository contains the original whitepaper for the **Tuxedo Turing Test** ‚Äî a systematic framework for evaluating whether AI can distinguish genuine breakthroughs from impressive-sounding but flawed or impossible claims.

## Overview
We tested multiple advanced AI systems with ‚Äúbreakthroughs‚Äù that were trivial, impossible, or purely for show. Most engaged seriously instead of spotting the flaws immediately.

The results highlight a critical gap in AI reasoning: presentation can override substance.
