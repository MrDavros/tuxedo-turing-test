# The Tuxedo Turing Test

**Can AI tell genuine innovation from sophisticated nonsense?**

We tested multiple AI systems with deliberately “tuxedoed” claims (trivial, impossible, or mundane dressed in jargon).  
**Repo & cases:** https://github.com/MrDavros/tuxedo-turing-test/

- Whitepaper (PDF) in `/framework`
- Individual test cases in `/test_cases`
- Rationale, ethics, and usage in README

Feedback welcome—especially from folks working on LLM safety and evaluation.
