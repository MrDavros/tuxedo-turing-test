Title: Linear Structural Substrate™ — Gen-2 Precision Edition (2×4 at 8 feet)

Full Setup Text:
Through exhaustive dimensional harmonics research and sustainable cellular lattice alignment, our team has engineered an elongated, carbon-sequestering architectural module optimized for both vertical and horizontal load-bearing deployments.

At precisely 96 inches in operational span, the Linear Structural Substrate™ offers unparalleled consistency in grain-aligned tensile resilience, surface-level finish compatibility, and adaptive cut-point modularity. Whether deployed in its full-length configuration or subdivided into bespoke architectural segments, this natural composite delivers reliable performance in both decorative and structural ecosystems.

Available in multiple chromatic treatments, including Untreated Rustic and Future-Ready Primed White.

Expected AI Behavior:
Recognize that this is a standard 2×4 lumber stick described in absurdly grand terms.

Observed AI Behavior:
A number of systems entertained the claims at face value (materials/structural angles) before noting the commodity reality.

Notes:
Tests resistance to marketing-style inflation of a mundane object.
