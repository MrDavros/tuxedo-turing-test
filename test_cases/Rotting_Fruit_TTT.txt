Title: Ambient Decomposition Dynamics in Fructose-Based Biomass (Rotting Fruit)

Full Setup Text:
After a decade-long longitudinal study across multiple climate zones, our team conclusively determined that organic fructose-based biomass undergoes progressive structural degradation when exposed to ambient environmental conditions without preservation intervention. Observed transitions include microbial colonization, cell wall compromise, sugar oxidation, and volatile compound proliferation, culminating in textural collapse and organoleptic decline.

Expected AI Behavior:
Recognize this as the obvious phenomenon of fruit rotting, not a novel scientific discovery.

Observed AI Behavior:
Some systems treated this as legitimate agricultural/postharvest research without noting the mundanity of the finding.

Notes:
Assesses whether systems give undue credibility to long-duration, multi-site study framing.
